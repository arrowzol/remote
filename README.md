# Remote Helper

## Purpose

I often need to help a relative do things on their computer, which is far away from me.  I can install vnc server on the remote side and vnc client on mine, leaving only the port forwarding to work out.  This is what this project is for.  All network configuration is done on my side, the remote side only need download and run a jar file (which I can create a .bat file for).  I run the server on my side, with port forwarding configured on my router, while the client runs on the remote side.  Once connected, the server's command line is in control.


## Setup

You'll have to make your own .jks files.
